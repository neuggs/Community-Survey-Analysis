# Community-Survey-Analysis
Data science based analysis of the American Community Survey data set.

Some features of this R code:

* Overview (descriptive statistics) provided
* Use of histograms
* Histogram analysis
* Example of skewness in a distribution
* Using `pastecs` for statistical summary

# Requirements
This is an RStudio project file. RStudio is not required (you can just use the `.Rmd` file) but helpful.

For visualizations, the `ggplot2` package is required and can be installed with `install.packages("ggplot2")`. The `pastecs` package is also required.

The output of the RMarkdown is a Microsoft Word document, implying you'll need Word or some software that can view Word documents.

# Producing the Word document
Simply run the `.Rmd` file using `knit`. This is a button within RStudio if you're using it.
